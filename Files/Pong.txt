Mini-project description - Pong

=================================================

Two player game each having control over their gutters(PADS ON VERTICAL BOUNDARIES, MOVEABLE). Move your gutters to avoid ball and vertical boundaries collisions. Here, with each ball and gutter collision the speed of the ball increases by a small factor which makes it worth playing. Player with 0 or below score, loses the game.

Note: Graphics are provided by the coursera team but implementation is mine :P.
