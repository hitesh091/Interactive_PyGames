Mini-project description - RiceRocks (Asteroids)

=================================================

A single-player video game. Just save your ship against the rocks by shooting(SPACEBAR) them and hence generating higher scores. You've got 3 lives to do so. Yippy!  

Note: Graphics are provided by the coursera team but implementation is mine :P.
